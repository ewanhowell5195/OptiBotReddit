    "question": "How do I install OptiFine?",
    "answer": "First, Download OptiFine from https://optifine.net/downloads or https://optifined.net/downloads. The latest minecraft version will always be displayed, If you want an older version click “Show Older Versions”, if you want an older OptiFine version, click the “+ More” button under the latest OptiFine version for that Minecraft Version. Lastly, if you want a preview version of OptiFine, click the “+ Preview versions”. If you do not see any links, turn off your Ad-Blocker or Anti-Virus. If you do not wish to use/having issues with ad.fly, click the “Mirror” button.\n\nIf you wish to install OptiFine into the Vanilla Launcher, you will need to download Java (https://adoptium.net/), and select OpenJDK 16 Hotspot for 1.17+ Versions, and OpenJDK 8 Hotspot for 1.16.5 and below. You must then open the .jar file (which is what is downloaded from optifine.net) with javaw.exe (Located in `C:/Program Files/AdoptOpenJDK/<java version>/bin`) if on Windows, or just Java on Linux/macOS. If you are on windows and the .jar is not automatically assigned to java, and opening with java via the right-click context menu does not work, you may need jarfix: https://johann.loefflmann.net/downloads/jarfix.exe\n\nIf you use Forge you just need to drop the installer into the mods folder, make sure you have the supported Forge version, which is displayed to the right of the \"Changelog\" button. Fabric is much the same but you need an extra mod called OptiFabric alongside it, https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric.\n\nIf you want to use OptiFine with MultiMC:\nOpen OptiFine, in the same way as you were going to install to the vanilla launcher. Click Extract, Open the MultiMC instance settings to the version page, select “Add to minecraft.jar”, and select the extracted OptiFine file (ends in _MOD). You must run that version of Minecraft (not OptiFine) in the vanilla launcher first, however. https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/wiki/MultiMC-and-OptiFine#the-jar-mod-way-any-version"

    "question": "My OptiFine cape was stolen! What do I do?",
    "answer": "First of all, please note: **Administrators CAN NOT and WILL NOT move capes for you!!!**\n\nWith that said, login at https://optifine.net/login, and simply update the username for the cape. Make sure it is also marked as locked. If you cannot move the cape, just lock it for now and wait 24 hours before trying to update the username. **If you're not the person who made the donation for the cape, you will have to ask the original donator to perform these actions.** If your friend gave you the cape, ask them.\n\nIn a majority of cases, the following steps are probably not be necessary. However, if you want to be absolutely sure you're safe, this is the way to go: **First, scan your computer, and change your passwords IMMEDIATELY.** This should include your Email account, your Minecraft/Mojang account, and your OptiFine.net account. Ideally, it should also be in that exact order. All of this is to ensure no strangers have access to any of these relevant accounts. After the passwords have been updated, log in at https://optifine.net/login and follow the same steps above."

    "question": "I can't access the Cape servers/Mojang servers.",
    "answer": "If you've installed programs such as 999cape, Mantle, or Cloaks+ in the past, you need to uninstall them in order to see OptiFine Capes. If after uninstalling you can't see the cape at this link: [http://s.optifine.net/capes/ZenW.png] then try this.\n\n* Press Windows key + r, it then should open a window called \"run\"\n* Copy and paste this into the window ``powershell -command \"Start-Process notepad $env:windir\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\" -Verb runas``\n* It should open a prompt asking if you want notepad to make changes to your computer, press yes.\n* If there is a line that has s.optifine.net in it, remove it, then press save.\n\n[Video instructions](https://youtu.be/7lOwhAhpHZY)\n\n**Note**: This only works for Windows. If you're on macOS, please ask a support member for help."

    "question": "I can't see my cape!",
    "answer": "There are several reasons why it may not be working. Try these steps.\n- First, check that both ``Skin Customization -> Cape`` and ``Video Settings -> Details -> Show Capes`` are set to ON.\n\n- If that doesn't work, make sure that the cape is actually activated on your account. You can do this by going to ``Skin Customization -> OptiFine Cape -> Open Cape Editor`` and it should give you the cape editor. If the cape is not on your account even though it should be, check this FAQ: `My OptiFine cape was stolen! What do I do?`\n\n- Finally, if that doesn't work, check that you can see the purple cape at this address: http://s.optifine.net/capes/ZenW.png. If you cannot see it, please refer to this FAQ: `I can't access the Cape servers/Mojang servers.`\n\nIf you could see the cape at that URL and still cannot see your cape, please seek further support by creating a ticket in [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/3mMpcwW)."
